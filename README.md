🚖 SmartRide: Next-Gen Intelligent Cab Sharing
SmartRide is an advanced cab-sharing system that leverages graph algorithms for optimized routing, intelligent ride matching, and customizable fare splitting. It is built with scalability in mind and is designed to provide a smart, cost-effective, and efficient transportation solution.

🎯 Objective
To build an intelligent ride-sharing system that:

Calculates the shortest path between pickup and drop locations.

Matches riders based on proximity to optimize shared rides.

Splits fares dynamically based on ride distance.

Lays the foundation for a full-stack application with React and Node.js integration.

🛠 Technology Stack
Layer	Technology
Backend	TypeScript
Frontend	React.js (Planned) + Tailwind CSS
Middleware	Node.js (Planned)
Data APIs	Placeholder for Mapbox/OpenTraffic (Planned)

🚀 Features
Graph Optimization:
Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm in TypeScript to compute shortest paths in a city graph.

Ride Matching:
CLI-based prototype that matches ride requests based on source and destination proximity.

Fare Splitting:
Console application to dynamically calculate fare based on shared ride distance.

Modular Design:
Backend logic is modular and structured for easy integration with a frontend interface.

📊 Technical Progress
✅ Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Fully functional in TypeScript.

✅ Graph Creation – City modeled using adjacency lists.

✅ Ride Matching Logic – Proximity-based matching working in CLI.

✅ Fare Splitting Logic – Working fare calculator (console-based).

✅ GitHub Setup – Repository structured with modular commits.

🟡 React UI – In progress (to display ride inputs/output visually).

🟡 Node.js Middleware – Planned for backend–frontend communication.

❌ Traffic API Integration – Not yet implemented; placeholders added for future Mapbox or OpenTraffic support.
