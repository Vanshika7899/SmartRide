# 🚖 SmartRide: Next-Gen Intelligent Cab Sharing

**SmartRide** is an advanced cab-sharing system that leverages graph algorithms for **optimized routing**, **intelligent ride matching**, and **customizable fare splitting**. It is built with scalability in mind and designed to provide a smart, cost-effective, and efficient transportation solution.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent ride-sharing system that:

- 📍 Calculates the **shortest path** between pickup and drop locations  
- 🤝 Matches riders based on **proximity** to optimize shared rides  
- 💰 Splits fares **dynamically** based on ride distance  
- 🏗 Lays the foundation for a **full-stack application** with React and Node.js integration

## 🛠 Technology Stack

| Layer       | Technology                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Backend     | TypeScript                         |
| Frontend    | React.js *(Planned)* + Tailwind CSS |
| Middleware  | Node.js *(Planned)*                |
| Data APIs   | Placeholder for Mapbox/OpenTraffic *(Planned)* |

## 🚀 Features

### 🗺 Graph Optimization
- Implemented **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** in TypeScript to compute shortest paths in a city graph.

### 🤝 Ride Matching
- CLI-based prototype that matches ride requests based on **source and destination proximity**.

### 💸 Fare Splitting
- Console-based fare calculator that splits the total fare based on **ride distance**.

### 🧱 Modular Design
- Backend logic is **modular and structured**, ready for integration with frontend interface.
